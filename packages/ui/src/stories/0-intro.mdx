# Introduction

This library provides components to build Factorio-related tools. It exposes both a Factorio Data Dump in the
frontend that can be consumed by components and React hooks, as well as visual components that resemble the
Factorio UI.

This library is not associated or maintained by Wube, but is a fan project.

# Get Started

Install the library with npm:

```bash
npm install @factorioui/components
```

You can then use the components in your React application:

```jsx
import { FactorioDataProvider } from "@factorioui/components";

(
  <FactorioDataProvider path="/" loader={<>Loading...</>}>
    <EntityButton type="item" name="fusion-reactor" onClick={console.log} />
    <TooltipRoot />
  </FactorioDataProvider>
);
```

<Story of={EntityButtonStories.Sample} />

When using tooltips, make sure to include the `TooltipRoot` component somewhere in your app.

# Factorio Data Dump

The data-related part components of this library require a `FactorioDataProvider` to work. This in turn needs the
JSON data file as well as Factorio assets to be available on a server. This data, exported and generated on Factorio Space Age,
is available as part of the `@factorioui/data` package, which will be included as dependency of this library.

Make sure to host it as static data with your server. The data will be available in `node_modules/@factorioui/data/data/`.

When using vite, you can load that data like this in your vite config:

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  publicDir: "node_modules/@factorioui/data/data",
  plugins: [react()],
});
```

# Structure of this library

On the left of this storybook instance, all available components are listed. They are structured as follows:

- **Components**: Visual components that are just a UI-based implementation and can be used out of the box.
- **Parts**: Components bound to the Factorio Data dump. They need a `FactorioDataProvider` to work.
